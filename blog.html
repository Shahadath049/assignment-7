                    LocalStorage: <br>
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site​ <br>
sessionStorage: <br>
It is similar to localStorage.
Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted
The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​

                    The Global scope: <br>

A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.  <br>
The Block scope: <br>

So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

                <span>Question 3: </span> What is event loop in JavaScript?

                    An event loop is a programming construct that allows a program to handle multiple events or tasks simultaneously. It works by having the program keep track of all the events or tasks that need to be processed, and then processing them one by one as they come in. This can be a very efficient way to handle a lot of events or tasks, as it prevents the program from getting bogged down by having to process everything at once.The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed. This process will continue until all tasks have been completed.Event loops are most often used in programming languages that are based on the event-driven programming paradigm. This programming paradigm is based on the idea of responding to events as they occur, rather than executing a set of instructions in a predetermined order. Many graphical user interface (GUI) programs are written using the event-driven programming paradigm, as are many video games.

                <span>Question 4: </span> How many ways we can get undefined?
            </h2>
            <div class="p-6">
                <p class="container fs-4">
                    <span class="fs-3 text-warning fw-bold">Answer :</span> <br>
                    There are many ways you can get undefined. Some of them are down below: <br>
                    1. Variable that is not initialized will give undefined as output
                    2. Function with no return will provide undefined
                    3. Parameter that is not passed will be undefined
                    4. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined
                    5. Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined
                    6. Accessing array elements outside of the index range 
                    7. Deleting an element inside an array
                    8. If you set a value directly to "undefined" you will get undefined.
